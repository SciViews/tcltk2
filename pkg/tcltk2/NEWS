= tcltk2 news

== Version 1.0-9
* tile and Tktable Tcl packages are eliminated. tcltk2 now uses ttk widgets that
  come with Tk 8.5. You are supposed to install Tktable yourself (optional) if
  you need it. Note that recent R (version >= 2.9.0) install both Tcl/Tk 8.5 and
  Tktable 2.9 under Windows and Mac OS X. So, those two Tcl packages should be
  available without extra work on these OSes.

* The little Windows utility execdde.exe is no longer distributed with the
  tcltk2 package. It is available from http://www.sciviews.org/SciViews-R.

* With Tcl/Tk 8.5, system fonts are now correctly initialized. Thus,
  winSystemFonts() is not needed any more, and it is deleted from the package
  (it was only used internally at package loading).

* The Tcl/Tk package 'Winico' is now provided in source form and its DLL is
  compiled (Windows only).


== Version 1.0-8
* Most windows executables were removed. The rest is in /win and a configure.win
  / cleanup mechanism is used to install them under Windows only.

* BinaryFiles is added to declare these binaries.

* An error preventing system fonts to load in tk2fonts is corrected (thanks to
  B. Ripley).

* When the package was installed on a path with spaces, the SystemFonts.exe
  program was not executed properly under Windows. Quoting the command for
  system() solved the problem (thanks to Pascal Hirsh).

* Tile version of paned widget is disabled because it does not work any more
  with R 2.9.0 - Tcl/Tk 8.5.


== Version 1.0-7
* Detection of systme fonts used under Windows.


== Version 1.0-6
* Complete rewrite of the package using tile and a larger series of additional
  tk widgets.


== Version 0.9-5
* First version distributed on CRAN
