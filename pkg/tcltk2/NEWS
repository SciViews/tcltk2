= tcltk2 news

== Version 1.2-11

* After a problem for active menu items not displayed in a contrasted color on
  some platforms, tk2menu() function receives two new arguments:
  activebackground and activeforeground, but reasonable colors are used in case
  these are not provided, with a fallback to white on darkblue in case it is not
  possible to determine the color used for the current theme. That color is
  *not* change when the theme is changed of existing menu items (but it is for
  future menu items). This is due to the fact that Tk menus do not follow the
  ttk styling scheme.
  

== Version 1.2-10

* Reworked Author field in the DESCRIPTION file.

* A bug in tk2listbox() and several other tk2XXX() widgets when it is not
  possible to get fieldbackground color for the TEntry widget is corrected.
  (thanks Jaime Egido)


== Version 1.2-9

* New theme handling introduced in version 1.2-8 resulted in an invisible caret
  in text widget.
  
* Further tweaking of color themes: now fieldbackground for entry, combobox,
  canvas, listbox, mclistbox, tablelist, spinbox, text and ctext widgets (build
  using old Tk widgets or megawidgets) now default with the correct theme color.


== Version 1.2-8

* A better handling of fonts and colors for Tk widgets according to themes used
  for Ttk widgets using tk2theme(). Also for menus.
  
* The default font was not reset properly after switching back from radiance
  to another theme.


== Version 1.2-7

* A tk2tablelist() function added to create a tablelist widget (the Tcl package
  was distributed with tcltk2, but no convenient widget creator provided). A
  very simple example is also added in the document. The widget is very rich,
  and you will have to figure out by yourself how to access all its command from
  its original documentation.
  
* A tk2swaplist() dialog box is added.


== Version 1.2-6

* No additional ttk themes are loaded on startup any more. The required
  resources are now loaded on demand in the tk2theme() function [suggested by
  Milan Bouchet-Valat & John Fox]. Note that the additional themes 'plastik',
  'keramik', 'keramik_alt', 'clearlooks' and 'radiance' are not listed any more
  with tk2theme.list(), unless their resources are loaded using, e.g.,
  tk2theme("plastik"). Note also that the 'radiance' theme permanently changes
  fonts used by the Ttk widgets to fonts identical, or close to those used by
  Ubuntu.
  
* tk2theme() now tries to set the same background color for old tk widgets than
  the color used by ttk widgets. Suggested by Milan Bouchet-Valat.


== Version 1.2-5

* Clarifications of license terms for R code and additional Tcl libraries.


== Version 1.2-4

* Temporary objects are now located in SciViews:TempEnv instead of TempEnv.


== Version 1.2-3

* The Tk configuration sequence in .onLoad() is changed. 


== Version 1.2-2

* For some reasons, version 1.2-1 on CRAN looks like version 1.2-0 on R-Forge.
  This version is an update.

* tk2ico.XXX() function change (incompatible changes for some of them!) due to
  drop of winico.dll in favor of the full-Tcl 'ico' package. See ?tk2ico.set.


== Version 1.2-1

* The new ttk theme introduced in 1.2-0 have introduced a bug preventing the
  tcltk2 package to load on Windows OS when 'cat' program is not available (this
  bug was not catch by the test machines which had Rtools, and thus, 'cat',
  installed). This bug appeared in the internal .isUbuntu() function. Fixed.

* A couple of warnings for partial argument matching in tclTaskXXX() functions
  under R 2.15.0 are corrected.
  
* Documentation and demos for the tablelist Tk widgets are not distributed any
  more in the tcltk2 package, to keep its size compatible with CRAN requirements
  (no more than 5mb). Those are available from http://www.nemethi.de/.
  

== Version 1.2-0

* Clearlooks ttk theme added and made default theme under Linux. More modern
  look&feel for ttk widgets under Linux!
  
* Radiance ttk theme created and added. This matches ambiance and radiance
  themes under Ubuntu 11.x. This is the default theme used in Ubuntu.
  
* The tk widget tablelist is updated to version 5.5.

* tk2listbox() is completelly reworked to provide (autohide) scrollbars,
  integration with the tk2theme() and easier filling of its content.

* tk2label is now fully implemented.

* Many methods for tk2widget and tk2cfglist objects are now provided.

* tk2style(), tk2dataList() and tk2configList() provide info on style, config
  and data associated with a tk2widget.


== Version 1.1-6

* When setting options(scipen = -5) or lower, is.tk() returned FALSE, even if
  Tk package was installed. Corrected.


== Version 1.1-5

* Little correction in Winico.c that prevented it to compile correctly on all
  Windows architectures (thanks Prof. B. Ripley for the patch).
  

== Version 1.1-4

* Winico.c modified to compile on Windows 64-bit (but still not OK?).

* Added ttk themes plastik, keramik and keramik_alt. Ttk theme plastik is now
  used by default on other platforms than Windows.


== Version 1.1-3

* New /win/src/Makevars to make it compatible with the double compilation for
  Windows 32bit and 64bit. Thanks Prof. Brian Ripley.
  
* Correction of the example in ?tk2reg. Thanks Tony Plate.

* .onload() now works inside SciViews.


== Version 1.1-2

* Patch to .onload() and to source code of Winico0.6.c submitted by Prof. Brian
  Ripley to make tcltk2 working on 64-bit Windows. Thanks.


== Version 1.1-1

* A bug in tk2mclistbox, clailing for missing -state argument when selecting
  an item in the box is corrected, thanks to a patch provided by Christiane
  Raemsch (and slightly modified).
  

== Version 1.1-0

* Several Tcl packages are added, or upgraded:
  autoscroll 1.1 (added)
  ctext 3.2 (upgraded from 3.1)
  cursor 0.2 (upgraded from 0.1)
  datefiled 0.2 (added)
  Diagrams 0.2 (added)
  getstring 0.1 (added)
  history 0.1 (added)
  ico 0.1 (added, in partial replacement of Winico 0.6 )
  ipentry 0.3 (added)
  khim 1.0 (added)
  ntext 0.81 (added)
  snit 1.0 (added, and required by widget)
  swaplist 0.2 (added)
  tablelist 4.10 (added)
  tooltip 1.4 (added and in replacement of the buggy balloon 1.2)
  widget 3.0 (added)

* There are new tclAfterXxx() and tclTaskXxx() functions to schedule tasks to
  be executed later in R (using the Tcl 'after' function)


== Version 1.0-9

* tile and Tktable Tcl packages are eliminated. tcltk2 now uses ttk widgets that
  come with Tk 8.5. You are supposed to install Tktable yourself (optional) if
  you need it. Note that recent R (version >= 2.9.0) install both Tcl/Tk 8.5 and
  Tktable 2.9 under Windows and Mac OS X. So, those two Tcl packages should be
  available without extra work on these OSes.

* The little Windows utility execdde.exe is no longer distributed with the
  tcltk2 package. It is available from http://www.sciviews.org/SciViews-R.

* With Tcl/Tk 8.5, system fonts are now correctly initialized. Thus,
  winSystemFonts() is not needed any more, and it is deleted from the package
  (it was only used internally at package loading).

* The Tcl/Tk package 'Winico' is now provided in source form and its DLL is
  compiled (Windows only).


== Version 1.0-8

* Most windows executables were removed. The rest is in /win and a configure.win
  / cleanup mechanism is used to install them under Windows only.

* BinaryFiles is added to declare these binaries.

* An error preventing system fonts to load in tk2fonts is corrected (thanks to
  B. Ripley).

* When the package was installed on a path with spaces, the SystemFonts.exe
  program was not executed properly under Windows. Quoting the command for
  system() solved the problem (thanks to Pascal Hirsh).

* Tile version of paned widget is disabled because it does not work any more
  with R 2.9.0 - Tcl/Tk 8.5.


== Version 1.0-7

* Detection of system fonts used under Windows.


== Version 1.0-6

* Complete rewrite of the package using tile and a larger series of additional
  tk widgets.


== Version 0.9-5

* First version distributed on CRAN
