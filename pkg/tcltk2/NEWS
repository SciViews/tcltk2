* A couple of warnings for partial argument matching in tclTaskXXX() functions
  under R 2.15.0 are corrected.
  

== Version 1.2-0

* Clearlooks ttk theme added and made default theme under Linux. More modern
  look&feel for ttk widgets under Linux!
  
* Radiance ttk theme created and added. This matches ambiance and radiance
  themes under Ubuntu 11.x. This is the default theme used in Ubuntu.
  
* The tk widget tablelist is updated to version 5.5.

* tk2listbox() is completelly reworked to provide (autohide) scrollbars,
  integration with the tk2theme() and easier filling of its content.

* tk2label is now fully implemented.

* Many methods for tk2widget and tk2cfglist objects are now provided.

* tk2style(), tk2dataList() and tk2configList() provide info on style, config
  and data associated with a tk2widget.


== Version 1.1-6

* When setting options(scipen = -5) or lower, is.tk() returned FALSE, even if
  Tk package was installed. Corrected.


== Version 1.1-5

* Little correction in Winico.c that prevented it to compile correctly on all
  Windows architectures (thanks Prof. B. Ripley for the patch).
  

== Version 1.1-4

* Winico.c modified to compile on Windows 64-bit (but still not OK?).

* Added ttk themes plastik, keramik and keramik_alt. Ttk theme plastik is now
  used by default on other platforms than Windows.


== Version 1.1-3

* New /win/src/Makevars to make it compatible with the double compilation for
  Windows 32bit and 64bit. Thanks Prof. Brian Ripley.
  
* Correction of the example in ?tk2reg. Thanks Tony Plate.

* .onload() now works inside SciViews.


== Version 1.1-2

* Patch to .onload() and to source code of Winico0.6.c submitted by Prof. Brian
  Ripley to make tcltk2 working on 64-bit Windows. Thanks.


== Version 1.1-1

* A bug in tk2mclistbox, clailing for missing -state argument when selecting
  an item in the box is corrected, thanks to a patch provided by Christiane
  Raemsch (and slightly modified).
  

== Version 1.1-0

* Several Tcl packages are added, or upgraded:
  autoscroll 1.1 (added)
  ctext 3.2 (upgraded from 3.1)
  cursor 0.2 (upgraded from 0.1)
  datefiled 0.2 (added)
  Diagrams 0.2 (added)
  getstring 0.1 (added)
  history 0.1 (added)
  ico 0.1 (added, in partial replacement of Winico 0.6 )
  ipentry 0.3 (added)
  khim 1.0 (added)
  ntext 0.81 (added)
  snit 1.0 (added, and required by widget)
  swaplist 0.2 (added)
  tablelist 4.10 (added)
  tooltip 1.4 (added and in replacement of the buggy balloon 1.2)
  widget 3.0 (added)

* There are new tclAfterXxx() and tclTaskXxx() functions to schedule tasks to
  be executed later in R (using the Tcl 'after' function)


== Version 1.0-9

* tile and Tktable Tcl packages are eliminated. tcltk2 now uses ttk widgets that
  come with Tk 8.5. You are supposed to install Tktable yourself (optional) if
  you need it. Note that recent R (version >= 2.9.0) install both Tcl/Tk 8.5 and
  Tktable 2.9 under Windows and Mac OS X. So, those two Tcl packages should be
  available without extra work on these OSes.

* The little Windows utility execdde.exe is no longer distributed with the
  tcltk2 package. It is available from http://www.sciviews.org/SciViews-R.

* With Tcl/Tk 8.5, system fonts are now correctly initialized. Thus,
  winSystemFonts() is not needed any more, and it is deleted from the package
  (it was only used internally at package loading).

* The Tcl/Tk package 'Winico' is now provided in source form and its DLL is
  compiled (Windows only).


== Version 1.0-8

* Most windows executables were removed. The rest is in /win and a configure.win
  / cleanup mechanism is used to install them under Windows only.

* BinaryFiles is added to declare these binaries.

* An error preventing system fonts to load in tk2fonts is corrected (thanks to
  B. Ripley).

* When the package was installed on a path with spaces, the SystemFonts.exe
  program was not executed properly under Windows. Quoting the command for
  system() solved the problem (thanks to Pascal Hirsh).

* Tile version of paned widget is disabled because it does not work any more
  with R 2.9.0 - Tcl/Tk 8.5.


== Version 1.0-7

* Detection of system fonts used under Windows.


== Version 1.0-6

* Complete rewrite of the package using tile and a larger series of additional
  tk widgets.


== Version 0.9-5

* First version distributed on CRAN
