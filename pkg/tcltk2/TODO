= tcltk2 To Do list

* Despite I changed ::msgcat::mclocale to de, tk2chooseFont() is still in
  English (but it works for fr... why?)

* Rework tk2edit() [takes numeric only and return characters for the moment!
  rework also the button bar]

* Add toolbar, datefield, etc.

* For the tips: select background color and font from style (same for bwidgets)

* The package vignette

* Tcl/Tk features to add:
  info/winfo
  update Idle tasks (update idletasks)
  bgerror
  correct handling of catch result => procedure for that
  error to generate tcl errors
  exit to end the application?
  see if there is no 'file' stuff that could be useful for R
  interp and after for delayed execution of code
  memory
  package
  pkg_mkIndex
  puts: write code from Tcl to the R console
  functions to manipulate Macintosh resources
  tclvars
  unknown
  A function to display the Tcl/Tk help and additional package help from R
  Easier definition and retrieval of bindings (+ keysyms) and events
  Bitmap (2 colors) and image (+ IMG package? PPM/PGM and GIF by default)
  Cursors
  Experiment with focus -force! + lower/raise

* Make a demo section
