= tcltk2 - To do

* A bug appeared with mclistbox: selecting an item causes a Tcl error -state
  not defined.

* Despite I changed ::msgcat::mclocale to de, tk2chooseFont() is still in English (but it
  works for fr... why

* tile.use(FALSE) after loading tile does not work with tk2chooseFont()

* Rework tk2edit() [takes numeric only and return characters for the moment!
  rework also the button bar]

* Add twapi, toolbar, tkdnd, datefield and swaplist

* Rework the code to detect and work with ActiveState install under Linux

* For the tips: select background color and font from style (same for bwidgets)

* The package vignette

* Tcl/Tk features to add:
** info/winfo
** update Idle tasks (update idletasks)
** bgerror
** correct handling of catch result => procedure for that
** error to generate tcl errors
** exit to end the application?
** see if there is no 'file' stuff that could be useful for R
** interp and after for delayed execution of code
** memory
** package
** pkg_mkIndex
** puts: write code from Tcl to the R console
** functions to manipulate Macintosh resources
** tclvars
** unknown
** A function to display the Tcl/Tk help and additional package help from R
** Use of the msgcat Tcl package
** easier definition and retrieval of bindings (+ keysyms) and events
** bitmap (2 colors) and image (+ IMG package? PPM/PGM and GIF by default)
** cursors
** experiment with focus -force! + lower/raise
** font manipulation functions + homogeneity of fonts between R and Tk
** styles must be handled with option! + tk_setPalette?
** GUI designer for fixed place of widgets
** tk/tkvars to retrieve various tk information

* Make a demo section
