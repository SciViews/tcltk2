	* snitfaq.man: Fixed a number of typos reported by Bob Techentin,
	  see [SF Tcllib Bug 1050674].

2004-10-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.7 ========================
	* 

2004-09-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* snit.test: Fixed the tests which were dependent on the exact
	  order of results returned by [array names]. Which failed for Tcl
	  8.5. Added lsort and updated expected results, for canonical
	  comparison.

2004-09-18  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.man: 	Documented hierarchical methods and typemethods.

	* Everything:   Updated version to 0.97.

2004-09-16  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl	In "component foo -public name", the "-public
        		name" part is now implemented as "delegate method
			{name *} to foo".
	* snit.test     Added tests for "$type info typemethods", "$self
			info typemethods" and "$self info methods" for the
			case of hierarchical methods/typemethods, and
			fixed related bugs in snit.tcl.

2004-09-14  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl	Modified the implementation of hierarchical methods;
	* snit.test	this involved extending the syntax of method
			"using" patterns to better support the 
			hiearchical case.

	* snit.tcl      Extended the "delegate method *" and
	* snit.test     "delegate typemethod *" syntax to work better with
	                hierarchical methods.  
	                E.g., "delegate method {tail *} to tail" now maps
			"$self tail wag" to "$tail wag"

2004-09-12  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl	Added support for hierarchical type methods,
	* snit.test	analogously to the support for regular methods.
	* README.txt

	* snit.tcl	Refactored the compilation of hierarchical
	* snit.test	methods and typemethods to remove duplicated code.

2004-09-10  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl      Added support for hierarchical methods: methods
	* snit.test     with submethods.  The documentation has not yet
	* README.txt    been updated.

	* snit.tcl      Bug fix: "delegate method {a b} to comp" now produces
	* snit.test     the call "$comp a b" instead of "$comp a_b".

2004-09-04  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl      Bug fix: read-only options were read-only only
	* snit.test     if they weren't set at creation time; the 
	* README.txt    configure cache wasn't being cleared properly
	                after creation.

2004-08-28  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl:     Minor tweaks to instance creation to improve
	* dictionary    speed.  No major gain.  Also, -simpledispatch yes
	* snit.man	now supports instance renaming again.
	* snitfaq.man
	

2004-08-22  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl	Defined the -simpledispatch pragma.  Updated
	* snit.test     the test suite and the relevant documentation.
	* snit.man
	* README.txt
	* snitfaq.man
	* dictionary

2004-08-14  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl      Defined the -hastypemethods pragma, and added
	* snit.test     relevant tests and documentation.
	* snit.man      
	* README.txt
	* snitfaq.man

2004-08-12  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl      Under appropriate conditions, calling a
	* snit.test     snit::type command with no arguments will create
	* snit.man      an instance with an automatically generated name.
	* README.txt

2004-08-11  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl      Added the -hasinfo pragma, along with the
	* snit.test     appropriate tests.  Updated documentation.
	* snit.man
	* README.txt

	* snit.tcl      The "configure", "configurelist" and "cget"
	* snit.test     instance methods, along with the "options"
	* snit.man      instance variable, are defined only if the
	* README.txt    type defines at least one option (either
	                locally or by delegation).

2004-08-07  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* All files     Updated to Snit V0.96 for post-0.95 development.
	                Fixed bug: methods called via [mymethod] can now
	                return exotic return codes, e.g.,
			"return -code break"

2004-08-04  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snitfaq.man   Updated the Snit FAQ document.

	* snit.man      Finalized Snit V0.95, and updated the version number
	* snit.tcl      throughout.
	* pkgIndex.tcl
	* README.txt

2004-07-27  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.man      Updated the manpage to describe the new "pragma"
	                statement.  Also, changed the SNIT acronym in the
	                title to "Simple Now In Tcl", i.e., objects are
	                now simple.

	* snit.tcl	Added another pragma, -canreplace.  If false
	* snit.test     (the default) snit::types can no longer create
	* README.txt    instances which replace existing Tcl commands.
	* snit.man      Setting "pragma -canreplace yes" restores the
	* dictionary    previous behavior.

	* snit.tcl	The type definition statements "variable" and
	* snit.test     "typevariable" now take a "-array" option that
	* README.txt    allows them to initialize array variables with
	* snit.man      an "array set" list.

	* snit.test     Fixed Snit bug 899207 (snit test failures)

	* snit.tcl	Added new instance introspection methods 
	* snit.test   	"info typemethods" and "info methods", and a new
	* README.txt    type introspection typemethod "info typemethods".
	* snit.man      
	* roadmap.txt

	* snit.man      Reviewed the entire man page, and made copious
	                changes and fixes.

	* snit.tcl	Revised many of the error messages to be more 
	* snit.test     Tcl/Tk-like.  Double-quotes are used instead of
			single quotes, and terminal periods are omitted.
	
	* snit.tcl	Added some code to method and typemethod dispatch
	* snit.test	so that the return code (e.g., return -code break)
			returned by the method/typemethod code is passed
			along unchanged.  This is mostly so that methods
			and typemethods can conditionally break in event 
			bindings.
	
2004-07-26  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl	Implemented -configuremethod and configure command
	* snit.test     caching; added tests to ensure that the cache is
	* roadmap.txt   cleared when necessary.  Implemented -validatemethod
	* dictionary    and added tests.  Implemented -readonly and added
	* README.txt    tests.

	* snit.man      Updated the man page with the new option
			definition syntax.

	* snit.tcl      Added the "pragma" statement, and three pragma
	* snit.test     options, -hastypeinfo, -hastypedestroy, and
	* roadmap.txt   -hasinstances, plus related tests.  It still
	* dictionary    needs to be documented.

2004-07-25  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl 	Renamed some procs for clarity, and repaired some
	* roadmap.txt   omissions in roadmap.txt.  Added "cget" command
	* snit.test     caching for additional speed-up.
	* dictionary.txt

2004-07-24  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl      (::snit::RT.MethodCacheLookup): The cached command
	        	is now generated as a list, not a string; this
			improves the speed of method invocation by quite a 
			bit.

2004-07-24  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl	Consolidated the option typevariables into a
	* dictionary	single array, Snit_optionInfo.  Implemented
	* roadmap.txt	parsing of the new option definition syntax;
	* snit.test	the -validatemethod, -configuremethod, and
			-cgetmethod options as yet have no effect.
			Added tests to ensure that the 'option' and
			'delegate option' statements populate
			Snit_optionInfo properly.

			Added "starcomp" to the Snit_optionInfo array.
			When "delegate option *" is used, "*" no longer 
			has a "target-$opt" entry, nor does it appear
			in "delegated-$comp".  Instead, "starcomp" is the
			name of the component to which option "*" is
			delegated, or "".

			Reimplemented user-defined "cget" handlers using
			the "-cgetmethod" option definition option.  
			The "oncget" statement now defines a method, and
			sets the option.

2004-07-21  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* README.txt 	Updated to reflect recent changes.
	* snit.man

2004-07-20  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl	Finished the refactoring job.  All extraneous
	* roadmap.txt	code has been moved from the type templates to the
			::snit:: runtime.

2004-07-19  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl	Refactored %TYPE%::Snit_optionget to 
	* roadmap.txt	::snit::RT.OptionDbGet. Refactored 
			%TYPE%::Snit_cleanup to ::snit::RT.DestroyObject,
			%TYPE%::Snit_tracer to ::snit::RT.InstanceTrace,
			and %TYPE%::Snit_removetrace to
			::snit::RT.RemoveInstanceTrace.

2004-07-17  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl	  Added "delegate typemethod ..." in all its glory,
	* snit.test	  including "delegate typemethod *".  Made it 
	* dictionary.txt  Possible to delegate an instance method to a
	* roadmap.txt	  typecomponent.  Added tests to ensure that
			  variable/typevariable and component/typecomponent 
			  names do not collide.  Updated a number of 
			  compilation error messages for consistency.
			  Moved the remaining typemethod definitions from the 
			  template code and replaced them delegations to
			  the Snit runtime library.  Added/modified
			  relevant tests, and updated the roadmap and 
			  dictionary files.  

2004-07-15  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl 	Replaced the old typemethod definition and
			cacheLookup code with new pattern-based code, just
			like the method definition and lookup.  The
			cache lookup routine doesn't yet understand 
			typemethod "*".  The next step is to implement
			typecomponents and "delegate typemethod".

	* dictionary.txt  Documented the changes related to the above
			change. 

2004-07-14  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl      Replaced %TYPE%::Snit_comptrace with
                        snit::RT.ComponentTrace.

			Replaced %TYPE%::Snit_cacheLookup with
			snit::RT.MethodCacheLookup

			Replaced %TYPE%::Snit_typeCacheLookup with
			snit::RT.TypemethodCacheLookup

	* snit.test	Added a test to verify that a widget's hull
			component cannot be altered once it is set.
	
	* roadmap.txt   Documents the internal structure of snit.tcl.
	
2004-07-11  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl	Renamed a number of internal commands, for
	                clarity.  

			Refactored the standard method bodies
			out of the type definition and into the Snit
	                runtime using delegation.

			Defined snit::compile which compiles a 
			type definition into the Tcl script which
			actually defines the type.

	* snit.test     Added and modified appropriate tests.

	* README.txt    Added a bullet about snit::compile.

2004-07-05  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl      Replaced the old method cacheLookup code with new
	                code based on command patterns.  All tests pass;
	                no test changes were needed.  All is now ready to
	                add the new "delegate method" "using" keyword.
	* dictionary.txt
	                This file documents Snit's private variables.
	                It's up-to-date, and checked in for the first
	                time.

	* snit.tcl      Implemented the new "using <pattern>" clause to
	* snit.test    	"delegate method", and added relevant tests.

	* snit.man      Documented the new "delegate method" syntax.
	* README.txt

2004-07-04  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl      Re-implemented the option and method delegation 
	* snit.test     syntax so that the order of clauses is no longer
	                important.  Along the way, I made the relevant
			error messages more specific.

2004-06-26  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl	Added the "component" statement, with two options, 
	* snit.test     -public and -inherit.  Added all relevant tests.
	* snit.man      Updated the man page to describe it.

2004-05-30  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.man      Updated per 0.94 changes to date; also I made a
                	sweep through the whole document and cleaned
	        	things up here and there for readability.

2004-05-29  Will Duquette  <will@wjduqette.com>

	* snit.tcl      Moved Snit_component to snit::Component.
	                
	                Removed the "type" argument from all of the
			"Type.*" procs.  Instead, the compilation type
			is available as $compile(type).  Consequently,
			the Type.* procs can now be aliased into the
			compiler just once, instead of with every type
			definition.  (Did that.)

			Defined snit::macro.

	* snit.test     Added tests for snit::macro.

2004-05-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.6.1 ========================
	* 

2004-05-15  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl:     Updated version to 0.94
	* pkgIndex.tcl: 

	* snit.tcl:     Modified the Snit_dispatcher function to
	                use a method command cache.  Method commands
			are assembled in Snit_cacheLookup only if
			they aren't found in the cache.  The 
			new Snit_dispatcher was much shorter,
			so its code was moved into the object's
			instance command, and Snit_dispatcher
			was deleted altogether.  These changes 
			speed up method calls considerably.

			Snit_tracer was then modified to clear the
			method cache when the instance command is 
			renamed--the cached commands contained the
			old instance command name.

	* snit.test:    Components can be changed dynamically; the
	                method cache breaks this, because the 
			previous component's command is still
			cached.  Added a test that checks whether
			the method cache is cleared properly when
			a component is changed.

	* snit.tcl:	Snit_comptrace now clears the method cache
	                when a component is redefined.

	* snit.tcl:     Added a type method cache.  Type methods 
	                (with the exception of implicit "create") are
			now as fast as instance methods.  This is a
			naive implementation, though--for typemethods,
			the cache could be populated at definition
			time, since there's no delegation.  Of course,
			if I added typemethod delegation then what I'm
			doing is appropriate.

	* snit.tcl:     Reorganized some things, in preparation to move
	                shared code from the type definition to the 
			snit:: namespace.

	* snit.tcl:	Made %TYPE%::mymethod an alias to snit::MyMethod.

	* snit.tcl:	Added %TYPE%::myproc, as an alias to 
	* snit.test:    snit::MyProc.  "codename" is now deprecated.
			Added tests for myproc.

	* snit.tcl:     %TYPE%::codename is now an alias to
	                snit::CodeName.

	* snit.tcl:     Added %TYPE%::myvar and %TYPE%::mytypevar; these
	                replace %TYPE%::varname and %TYPE%::typevarname,
			which are now deprecated.  All are now implemented
			as aliases to calls in snit::.

	* snit.tcl:     %TYPE%::variable is now an alias to
	                snit::variable.

	* snit.tcl:     %TYPE%::from is now an alias to snit::From.

2004-02-26  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* snit.test:    Codified the requirement of Tcl 8.4 into
	* pkgIndex.tcl: package index and test suite.

2004-02-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.6 ========================
	* 

2004-02-07  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* README.txt:  Added 0.93 information to README.txt.

	* snit.tcl:    Fixed bug: "$obj info vars" used to leave out "options"
	* snit.test:   if no options were defined.  It's clearer if the 
	               behavior is always the same.

		       Fixed tcllib bugs item #852945: variable.  The
		       statement "variable ::my::qualified::name" in an
		       instance method now makes "name" available, just
		       as the standard "variable" command does.

		       Fixed bug: in some cases the type command was
		       created even if there was an error defining the
		       type.  The type command is now cleaned up in these
		       cases.  (Credit Andy Goth)

	* snit.tcl:    Implemented RFE 844766: need ability to split class
	* snit.test:   defs across files.  Added the snit::typemethod and
	* snit.html:   snit::method commands; these allow typemethods and
		       methods to be defined after the class already exists.

2004-02-07  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* All:         Updated version to 0.93.
	* snit.tcl:    The %AUTO% name counter wraps around to 0 when it
	               reaches 2^31 - 1, to prevent integer overflow
		       errors.
	* snit.html:   Minor corrections and updates.
	* faq.html

2003-12-06  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* All:         Updated version to 0.92.

	* snit.tcl     Snit now propagates errorCode properly when 
	* snit.test    propagating errors.

2003-12-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* snit.man:    Updated to changes in the .html files.
	* snitfaq.man: 

2003-11-21  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl:      Updated version to 0.91.
	* pkgIndex.tcl: 

	* snit.tcl:      Added the "expose" statement to type and widget
	                 definitions.
	* snit.test:     Added appropriate tests.
	* snit.html:     Added documentation for "expose".
	* faq.html:      Updated the FAQ entries.

	* snit.tcl:      Added "string match" patterns to the Snit info
	                 methods.
	* snit.test:     Added appropriate tests.
	* snit.html:     Updated documentation.


2003-10-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* snit.man:    Fixed typos in documentation.
	* snitfaq.man: 

2003-10-27  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.html: Fixed typos in documentation.
	* faq.html:

2003-10-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* snit.man:    Updated to changes in the .html files.
	* snitfaq.man: 

2003-10-25  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl:  Added the "except" clause for "delegate method *" and
	* snit.test: "delegate option *".  This allows the user to
	  	     explicitly exclude certain methods and options.
		     Added appropriate tests.

	* snit.html: Gave the Snit FAQ a bit of an overhaul, and added 
	* faq.html:  information corresponding to the recent code
	  	     changes, including a great deal of material on Snit
		     and the Tk option database.  Updated the Snit man
		     page to be consistent with the recent code changes.

2003-10-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* snit.man: Updated from Will's html doc's.

2003-10-23  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.html: Added documentation for the new "hulltype",
	  	     "widgetclass", and "install" commands.  Updated the
	  	     documentation for "installhull" to show the new
	  	     "installhull using" syntax.  Updated the
	  	     documentation for "option" and "delegate option" to
	  	     show how to specify the resource and class names for
	  	     options.  Added a section on the interaction between
	  	     Snit and the Tk option database.

	* snit.tcl:  Add the "hulltype" command.  This allows the snit::widget 
	* snit.test: author to choose whether the hull should be a frame
	  	     or a toplevel.  Tests have been updated as usual.

2003-10-20  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl:  The new "install" command can now be used to install
	* snit.test: components for snit::types as well.  It doesn't add
		     any value, since there's no option database, but at
	             least the syntax will be the same.

		     "install" now initializes the component properly
		     from the option database when "option *" has been
		     delegated to it.

		     Tests have been updated as usual.

2003-10-19  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.tcl:  During normal widget creation, the default values
	* snit.test: for a widget's local options are overridden by
	  	     values from the option database.

		     Array %TYPE%::Snit_compoptions now lists delegated 
		     option names for each component.

		     Added a new command, "install", for use in widget
		     and widgetadaptor constructors.  Install creates a
		     widget, assigning it to a component; it also queries
		     the option database for any option values that are
		     delegated to this component.

		     Modified installhull, adding a new form that queries
		     the option database as appropriate for options
		     delegated to the hull widget.

		     At this point, the only options whose default values
		     do not come from the option database in the proper
		     way are those implicitly delegated by "delegate
		     option *" to a non-hull widget.  I need to think
		     about those.

		     Of course, new tests have been added for all of this.

		     The version number in snit.tcl has been updated to 0.84.

	* snit.tcl:  Added the "widgetclass" statement; this allows
	* snit.test: snit::widgets (and nothing else) to explicitly set
	             the widget class name passed to the hull as "-class".
	             In addition, the hull's -class is set automatically, 
		     to the explicit widgetclass, if any, or to the 
		     widget type name with an initial capital letter.

                     Next, an object's options now have real resource
                     and class names, which are reported correctly by 
                     "$obj configure".  By default, the resource name
                     is just the option name minus the hyphen, and
                     the class name is just the resource name with an
                     initial capital.

                     In both the "option" and "delegate option"
                     statements, the option name may be specified as
                     a pair or a triple, e.g.,

                       option {-name name Name}

                     Thus, the resource name and class name can be
                     specified explicitly.

                     In previous versions, the resource name and
                     class name returned by configure for delegated
                     options was the resource name and class name
                     returned by the component.  This is no longer
                     true; configure now returns the resource and
                     class name defined in the type definition.

2003-10-17  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* snit.html: Added typeconstructor documentation.
	* faq.html:  

	* snit.tcl: Implemented typeconstructors.  A typeconstructor's
                    body is executed as part of the compiled type
	            definition; it has access to all of the typevariables
	            and typemethods.  Its job is to initialize arrays,
	            set option database values, and like that.
	
	* snit.test: Added tests for typeconstructors.

2003-10-16  Will Duquette  <will@wjduquette.com>

	* README.txt: Updated to reflect snit's presence in tcllib, and
	  to point to this ChangeLog file.

2003-09-30  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* snit.tcl: A number of changes to the code generation part.
	  - Usage of [subst]'s was superfluous, removed, simple string
	    interpolation now.

	  - Now 'namespace eval type' enclosing the generated code
	    anymore. Such an eval is now done only at the top of the
	    generated code to define the namespace, and to
	    define/initialize the typevariables. All procedure definitions
	    are now outside of 'namespace eval' and use fully qualified
	    command names instead.

	  - Moved the code in [snit::Define] which instantiated the class
	    using the generated code into it own helper command,
	    [snit::DefineDo]. Overiding this command allows users of the
	    snit package perform other actions on the newly defined
	    class. One example is that of a snit-compiler which goes
	    through a file containing tcl code and replaces all snit::*
	    definitions with the generated code.

	  Motivation for the change: When applying procomp to procedure
	  definitions inside of a 'namespace eval' they are not
	  byte-compiled, but kept as encoded literal. This is a direct
	  consequence of 'namespace eval' not having a compile
	  function. It also means that introspection, i.e. [info body]
	  does recover the actual procedure definition. By using procedure
	  definitions outside of namespace eval, but fully qualified names
	  this limitation of procomp is avoided. The aforementioned snit
	  compiler application is another part for this, ensuring that
	  instead of keeping the whole class definition as one literal for
	  the snit::* call we actually have tcl code to compile and hide.

	* snit.tcl:     Updated the version number to 0.83
	* pkgIndex.tcl:
	* snit.man:
	* snitfaq.man:

2003-07-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* snit.test: Fixed SF tcllib bug #772535. Instead of using a
	* snit.tcl:  variable reference in the callback a regular command
	             is called, with the unchanging 'selfns' as argument.
		     From there things go through the regular dispatching
		     mechanism after the actual instance name was obtained.
		     Updated all affected tests.

		     Updated dmethod-1.5 also, 'string' delivers a
		     different error message.

2003-07-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* snit.man:    Added references to bug trackers, as part of
	* snitfaq.man: caveats. Also added note about bwidget/snit
	               interaction.

	* snit.tcl: Integrated latest (small) change to original code base
	  (was not released yet). Removes bad trial to fix up error stack.
	  We are now at version 0.82. Added note to developers explaining
	  the catch in Snit_tracer.
